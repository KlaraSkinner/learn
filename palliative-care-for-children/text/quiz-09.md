    -	Any sensation or feeling that is only experienced by a patient
2.	What is a symptom?
    -	A common cause of abdominal pain and distension
    +	Any sensation or feeling that is experienced only by a patient
    -	A clinical observation that is made by a doctor
    -	An abdominal mass or heart murmur
3.	Common symptoms experienced by children needing palliative care include:
    -	Pyrexia and tachycardia
    -	Hypertension or hypotension
    -	Large masses or tumours
    +	Breathlessness, nausea and constipation
4.	A principle of symptom management is:
    -	Only treat if the symptoms are severe
    -	Only treat if the child also has clinical signs
    +	Use both non-pharmacological and pharmacological management when treating a symptom
    -	Give a good explanation to the family but there is no need to treat the child
5.	Which of these is one of the four golden rules when assessing symptoms?
    +	Make a thorough assessment
    -	Ask the parents what the child complains of
    -	Give an explanation to the family of what you are assessing
    -	Use pharmacological rather than non-pharmacological strategies to treat the patient’s symptoms
6.	Shortness of breath can be made worse by:
    -	Depression
    -	Nausea and vomiting
    +	Anxiety
    -	Insomnia
7.	Shortness of breath that is severe in end-of-life care can be treated pharmacologically with:
    +	A low dose of morphine
    -	Nebulisation with saline
    -	Physiotherapy
    -	Aromatherapy 
8.	The noise made by excessive secretions at the end-of-life is also referred to as: 
    +	The death rattle
    -	Blowing bubbles
    -	Grunting
    -	Noisy breathing
9.	Excessive secretions at the end-of-life are caused by:
    -	Drinking too much milk
    -	Treatment with a diuretic
    -	Taking in excessive amounts of clear fluids
    +	The child’s inability to cough or swallow secretions
10.	A way to manage excessive secretions at the end-of-life include:
    -	Continuous deep suctioning
    -	Using only medication to dry up secretions
    +	Roll the patient onto the side to facilitate drainage of secretions
    -	Giving extra fluids to make sections thinner
11.	 Nausea and vomiting are triggered via receptors in:
    -	The gastrointestinal tract only
    +	The gastrointestinal tract, the brain and the vestibular apparatus
    -	The brain only
    -	The vestibular apparatus only
12.	A possible underlying cause of projectile vomiting could be:
    -	Hiccups
    -	A urinary tract infection
    +	Raised inter cranial pressure
    -	Pneumonia
13.	 A strategy to help manage nausea and vomiting may include:

    -	Include spicy foods into the diet
14.	 A prokinetic such as metoclopramide given for nausea and vomiting works on the:
    -	Vomiting centre
    -	The chemo-receptor trigger zone
    -	Vestibular apparatus

15.	An anti-emetic that works on the chemo-receptor-zone is:
    +	Haloperidol
    -	Maxalon
    -	Cyclizine
    -	Metoclopramide
16.	 Cyclizine is an anti-emetic which works on the: 
    -	Chemo-receptor trigger zone
    -	The gastrointestinal tract
    +	The vomiting centre in the brain
    -	The vestibular apparatus
17.	 A common cause of constipation is due to:
    +	The side effects of medication such as opioids
    -	The use of anti-emetics
    -	Over hydration
    -	The use of anti-inflammatories
18.	Constipation needs to first be managed by:
    -	Immediately starting a laxative
    -	Reducing fluids and fibre in the diet

19.	 To prevent constipation:
    -	Use a different laxative daily

    -	A bowel stimulant like bisacodyl suppositories
    +	An osmotic laxative like lactulose to soften the stool
    -	A glycerine suppository
