# **Appendix H** Drug formulary
{:title="Drug formulary"}

<div class="wide" markdown ="1">
A detailed Association for Paediatric Palliative Medicine’s (APPM) 2020 formulary with drug names, doses, side effects and contraindications can be accessed via the [PatchSA website](http://patchsa.org/patchsa_ppc_formulary/).

The APPM formulary is the leading international resource and only authoritative guide on prescribing in paediatric palliative care. Many of these medicines are prescribed ‘off-licence’ and ‘on expert opinion’ as it is difficult to do studies in this vulnerable population. Caution needs to be exercised in children with renal or liver dysfunction and dose adjustments need to be made. Do note not all of the formulations mentioned in this resource are available in South Africa.

You can access the APPM formulary here: http://patchsa.org/patchsa_ppc_formulary/
