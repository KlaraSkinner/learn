    -  We need to find out if the child has siblings or is an only child
    +  As all family members are emotionally connected individuals, none can be fully understood on their own

    -  Give them medicine to help them cope with their stress and depression
    +  Act as a mediator and assist the family to understand each other’s feelings and concerns and assist them in finding their own way forward
    -  Advising them not to think too much about the child’s illness and possible death as this will only increase their anxiety and sadness

    -  Leave the family to do what they need to do and only get involved when they ask
18. Siblings of children with a serious illness:
    -  Should understand that the needs of the sick child are more important than the needs of the siblings at this time
    -  Should be asked to take over chores at home so their parents can focus on the sick child
    -  Should be expected to be on their best behaviour during this difficult time
    +  May experience feelings of guilt for things they have said to their sick sibling in the past and become anxious and withdrawn
19. How can parents show support to siblings?
    -  Buying them gifts and sweets so they don’t feel jealous
    +  Spending time alone with the siblings and keeping in contact with them when they are away at the hospital
    -  Telling them all their worries and concerns about the sick child
    -  Expecting them to keep doing their best at school and helping around the home
20. How can we allow the patient and family self-determination?

    -  Tell them what it is we expect them to do
    -  Persuade them to do what we believe to be in the best interests of the child and the family
    -  Explain that we will no longer support them if they make choices we don’t believe to be in their best interest
