### The International Children’s Palliative Care Network (ICPCN) charter of rights for life-limited and life-threatened children

1.  Every child should expect individualised, culturally and age appropriate palliative care as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)[^1]. The specific needs of adolescents and young people shall be addressed and planned for.

2.  Palliative care for the child and family shall begin at the time of diagnosis and continue alongside any curative treatments throughout the child’s illness, during death and in bereavement. The aim of palliative care shall be to relieve suffering and promote quality of life.

3.  The child’s parents or legal guardians shall be acknowledged as the primary care givers and recognised as full partners in all care and decisions involving their child.

4.  Every child shall be encouraged to participate in decisions affecting his or her care, according to age and understanding.

5.  A sensitive but honest approach will be the basis of all communication with the child and the child’s family. They shall be treated with dignity and given privacy irrespective of physical or intellectual capacity.

6.  Every child or young person shall have access to education and wherever possible be provided with opportunities to play, access leisure opportunities, interact with siblings and friends and participate in normal childhood activities.

7.  The child and the family shall be given the opportunity to consult with a paediatric specialist with particular knowledge of the child’s condition where possible, and shall remain under the care of a paediatrician or doctor with paediatric knowledge and experience.

8.  The child and the family shall be entitled to a named and accessible key-worker whose task it is to build, coordinate and maintain appropriate support systems which should include a multidisciplinary care team and appropriate community resources.

9.  The child’s home shall remain the centre of care whenever possible. Treatment outside of this home shall be in a child-centred environment by staff and volunteers, trained in palliative care of children.

10. Every child and family member, including siblings, shall receive culturally appropriate, clinical, emotional, psychosocial and spiritual support in order to meet their particular needs. Bereavement support for the child’s family shall be available for as long as it is required.

### Communication role plays

The objectives of a role play are to:

1.  Enable you to learn and practice effective communication skills that allow you to facilitate therapeutic relationships and decision making with a child and family.

2.  Facilitate difficult conversations and break bad news to children and the family in a safe environment without upsetting patients.

Role play uses real life situations, but provides opportunities for participants to practice in a simulated situation.

### Instructions for the communication role plays

#### Role play 1 – Basic communication skills

1.  Read through the scenarios together as a group.

2.  The group facilitator will hand out the communication assessment tool and self reflection tool and read through it with the group.

3.  The group will be divided into subgroups of three people each. Two people will be the role players and the third will be the peer assessor who will complete the communication assessment tool.

4.  Each person will take a turn at being the assessor, the patient and the professional healthcare worker conducting the communication session.

5.  Only the healthcare professional will need to be assessed with each role play conducted.

6.  The role play can be stopped frequently by the assessor, either for discussion of an interesting point or if the assessor detects that one of the players is having difficulties.

7.  Once each role play is complete the assessor should get feedback from the role players on how well they thought the discussion went. The healthcare professional role player can use the self reflection tool to guide the discussion as to what went well and what didn't go well for themselves.

8.  The assessor will then give positive feedback from the communication assessment tool to the healthcare professional only (not the patient) on how they conducted the conversation with the patient. When the positive feedback has been discussed, the assessor asks the role players if there is anything they feel that they could have done better.

9.  Once the role play has been completed, the role players must ‘de-role’. This is the process of separating who they are as a person from the role that they just played. There are several ways to carry out this important part of a role play. One of these is to have the role players say their own name and say that they are not the character name they have been role playing.

10. Once the role players have ‘de-roled’ they will swop around and the same process will take place until all three participants have had a turn at being the assessor, healthcare professional and patient.

#### Scenario:

Thandi is 5 years old. She has been receiving treatment for leukaemia for 3 months. Thandi is normally a very upbeat and smiley child but this week she is very withdrawn. As part of the treating team who has the best relationship with Thandi, you have been asked to go and chat with her.

#### Role players:

Thandi

The healthcare professional (nurse, doctor or social worker)

#### Roleplay the following situation:

Thandi is sitting on her bed with her back towards the door. Her favourite things – colouring book, crayons and her teddy – are on the side-table behind her. Role play how you would approach Thandi and find out what is bothering her.

#### Role play 2 – Breaking bad news

**(**Based on case study 4 in Chapter 3)

The group facilitator should ask for five volunteers to role play in front of the group. The remaining group members will assess the role play individually on the communication assessment tool they were each given. The group facilitator will lead the feedback session.

When conducting the role play in this manner it is important to remember that:

1.  The role play can be stopped frequently by the facilitator, either for discussion of an interesting point or if the facilitator detects that one of the players is having difficulties.

2.  The group facilitator will conduct the feedback session as discussed in points seven and eight in role play 1. Once the role players and the group facilitator have given their feedback the group facilitator can ask the group members to give their feedback. Firstly, on what went well and then what they think could have been done better.

3.  It is very important that the role player’s ‘de-role’ as discussed in point nine in role play 1.

#### Scenario:

Devon is a 9-year-old who has suffered a severe head injury and may not survive. He is currently admitted to the ICU on a ventilator. His parents and 16-year-old sister, Tamara, are at his bedside. The family have been very active on social media asking that people pray for Devon. This has resulted in thousands of people following his progress online and encouraging his family to expect a miraculous recovery.

#### Role players:

Two healthcare professionals (doctor, nurse and/or social worker)

Devon’s mother

Devon’s father

Tamara

#### Role play the following situation:

Devon’s parents and his sister are at his bedside in a busy ICU ward. His mother is comforting Tamara, who is crying softly. Devon’s condition has stabilised for the moment but the prognosis for a recovery remains poor. Role play how you would break this distressing news to his parents and to Tamara.

### Communication assessment tool

Strong communication skills are important to develop the skills and competence needed in the workplace. Peer review is used for feedback. Honest and accurate feedback will help your peers to strengthen their communication skills and to identify gaps in their learning. Use the communication assessment tool to help guide the assessment of your peers’ communication skills.

### Debriefing model

Phase 1 – Introduction

In this phase, the team members conducting the debriefing introduce themselves and describe the process. They present guidelines for the conduct of the debriefing and they motivate the participants to engage actively in the process. Participation in the discussion is voluntary and the team keeps the information discussed in the session confidential. A carefully presented introduction sets the tone of the session, anticipates problem areas and encourages active participation from the group members.

Phase 2 – Facts

This phase helps the participants to begin talking. Request only brief overviews of the facts and discourage excessive detail. It is easier for participants to speak of what happened before they describe how the event impacted them. Giving the group members an opportunity to contribute a small amount to the discussion is enormously important in lowering anxiety and letting the group know that they have control of the discussion. This phase, however, should not form the bulk of the debriefing as there are more important parts yet to come. The usual question used to start the fact phase is; ‘Can you give our team a brief overview or “thumbnail sketch” of what happened in the situation from your viewpoint? We are going to go around the room and give everybody an opportunity to speak if they wish. If you do not wish to say anything just remain silent or wave us off and we will go onto the next person.’

Phase 3 – Thoughts

The thought phase is a transition from the cognitive domain toward the affective domain. It is easier to speak of one’s thoughts than to focus immediately on the most painful aspects of the event. The typical question addressed in this phase is; ‘What was your first thought or your most prominent thought once you realised you were thinking? Again, we will go around the room to give everybody a chance to speak if they wish. If you do not wish to contribute something, you may remain silent. This will be the last time we go around the group.’

Phase 4 – Reactions

The reaction phase is the heart of a debriefing. It focuses on the impact on the participants. Anger, frustration, sadness, loss, confusion and other emotions may emerge. The trigger question is; ‘What is the very worst thing about this event for you personally?’ The debriefing team listens carefully and gently encourages group members to add something if they wish. When the group runs out of issues or concerns that they wish to express the team moves the discussion into the next transition phase, the symptoms phase, which will lead the group from the affective domain toward the cognitive domain.

Phase 5 – Symptoms

In this phase, team members can ask questions such as; ‘How has this tragic experience shown up in your life?’ or ‘What cognitive, physical, emotional, or behavioural symptoms have you been dealing with since this event?’ The debriefing team listens carefully for common symptoms associated with exposure to traumatic events, stress or whatever the essence of the debriefing is about. The team will use the signs and symptoms of distress presented by the participants as a kicking off point for the teaching phase.

Phase 6 – Teaching

The team conducting the debriefing normalises the symptoms brought up by participants. They provide explanations of the participants’ reactions and provide stress management information. Other pertinent topics may be addressed during the teaching phase as required.

Phase 7 – Re-entry

The participants may ask questions or make final statements. The debriefing team summarises what has been discussed. Final explanations, information, action directives, guidance and thoughts are presented to the group. Handouts may be distributed.

# *Follow the Child: Planning and Having the Best End-of-Life Care for Your Child*

by Sacha Langton-Gilks

## Appendix F

### Using the QUESTT approach to assess the child

## The ‘Q’ in QUESTT: Question the child and parent/caregiver.

-   By 18 months, most children have a word to describe pain for example, a ‘hurt’ or an ‘eina’.

-   Pain intensity can be described by children with a cognitive age of 4 years old.

-   The gold standard for reporting pain is self-reporting as it is subjective and individual to the child.

-   Parents understand and know their child therefore they will be able to recognise subtle behavioural changes.

-   Parents may be more motivated to recognise pain in their child in order to help alleviate it.

Use the following acronym to ask questions about the pain:

**P:** *Precipitating, palliating, provoking factors*:

-   What causes the pain?

-   What makes the pain better?

-   What makes the pain worse?

**Q:** *Quality, quantity:*

-   What does the pain feel like?

-   Is it sharp, stabbing, burning, and/or stinging?

**R:** *Radiation, related factors:*

-   Where is the pain?

-   Is it in one place or does the pain move? If so, where does it move to?

**SS:** *Severity, site:*

-   How severe is the pain at the site?

-   Score the intensity using pain rating scales (see appendix G).

**TT:** *Time course, treatment:*

-   When did it start?

-   Is it there all the time?

-   Is it mainly at night or in the day?

-   Is the pain worse when you move?

-   How long does the pain last?

The ‘U’ in QUESTT: Use pain rating scales.

-   Pain rating scales are useful for establishing a baseline and for measuring response to treatment.

-   Different scales have been developed for different ages and levels of development in both non-verbal and verbal children.

-   Use one that is appropriate to the child’s culture and developmental level. Consider ease and time taken to administer the scale.

-   Find one or two that you are comfortable to use. There is no ideal rating scale.

-   Remember that children may deny pain for fear of consequences.

## 

## Appendix G

### Age appropriate pain rating scales

**Age appropriate pain rating scales include the following:**

1.  Neonates, infants: Neonatal pain rating scale (NIPS) or facial expression tool

2.  Nonverbal children or children under 3 years: FLACC scale

3.  Children over 3 years of age: Wong Baker Faces pain scale

4.  Children over 7 years of age: Numeric, word pain scale and Eland colour body tool

#### Neonates

Assessing a neonate’s facial expression is a useful way of identifying pain and distress. Typical facial signs of pain in neonates are the following:

1.  Eyebrows lowered and drawn together

2.  A bulge between the eyebrows and vertical furrows on the forehead

3.  Eyes slightly closed

4.  Cheeks raised, nose broadened and bulging, deepened nasolabial fold

5.  Open and squarish mouth.

#### Children 3 years of age and under

**FLACC scale**

Indications for use with:

-   infants and children to 3 years of age

-   children up to 7 years of age who are unable to validate the presence of, or quantify the severity of pain

-   any other non-verbal patient

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Face</strong></td><td><p>0</p><p>No particular expression or smile</p></td><td><p>1</p><p>Occasional grimace or frown, withdrawn disinterested</p></td><td><p>2</p><p>Frequent to constant frown, clenched jaw, quivering chin</p></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Legs</strong></td><td><p>0</p><p>Normal position or relaxed</p></td><td><p>1</p><p>Uneasy, restless, tense</p></td><td><p>2</p><p>Kicking, or legs drawn up</p></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Activity</strong></td><td><p>0</p><p>Lying quietly, normal position, moves easily</p></td><td><p>1</p><p>Squirming, shifting back and forth, tense</p></td><td><p>2</p><p>Arched, rigid or jerking</p></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Cry</strong></td><td><p>0</p><p>No cry</p><p>(awake or asleep)</p></td><td><p>1</p><p>Moans or whimpers, occasional complaint</p></td><td><p>2</p><p>Crying steadily, screams or sobs, frequent complaints</p></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Consolability</strong></td><td><p>0</p><p>Content, relaxed, no need to console</p></td><td><p>1</p><p>Reassured by occasional touching, hugging or ‘talking to’, distractible</p></td><td><p>2</p><p>Difficult to console or comfort</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Children over 3 years of age

**Faces pain scale revised**

<img src="/media/image2.jpeg" style="width:5.91597in;height:1.70885in" alt="mage result for free revised pain face diagram" />

> Ask the child to point to the face which indicates how bad or severe their pain is.

**Five-finger score**

Ask the patient to show how bad the pain is with their hand.

<img src="/media/image3.emf" style="width:6.75069in;height:0.90864in" /> 0 1 2 3 4 5

**no hurt hurts little bit hurts little more hurts even more hurts whole lot hurts worst**

Ask the child to show how bad the pain is with their hand. This is the internationally recognised version of this tool. In South Africa this tool has been adapted and may vary from region to region for example, a child showing you their thumb can mean thumbs up and ‘I am okay’. Therefore, always check what is used in a particular environment and ask the child what he or she means.

#### Children over 7 years of age

**Numerical Rating Scale for children over 7 years of age**

On a scale from 0 – 10, describe how strong your pain is.

|             |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |                         |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------------------------|
| **No pain** | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | **Worst possible pain** |

**Word pain scale**

|             |                 |                 |                 |                |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **No pain** | **Little pain** | **Medium pain** | **Severe pain** | **Worst pain** |

**Drawing pain**

Ask a child to ‘draw’ his or her pain. This often gives insight into the intensity and nature of the pain but may also reflect its psychosocial consequences or the child’s fears.

**Eland Body Tool**

**Directions for use:**

<img src="/media/image4.png" style="width:4.54545in;height:4.29236in" alt="Eland Color Scale Figures" />

After discussing with the child several things that have hurt the child in the past:

1.  Present three crayons or markers to the child.

2.  Ask the following questions, and after the child has answered, mark the appropriate square on the tool (e.g. severe pain, worst hurt), and put that colour away from the others. For convenience, the word ‘hurt’ is used here, but whatever term the child uses should be substituted. The phrase or word chosen will depend on the child's experience and what the child is able to understand. Some children may be able to imagine much worse pain than they have ever had, while other children can only understand what they have experienced. Of course, some children may have experienced the worst pain they can imagine. Ask the child these questions:

<!-- -->

1.  Of these colours, which colour is most like the worst hurt you have ever had, (using whatever example the child has given) or the worst hurt anybody could ever have?

2.  Which colour is almost as much hurt as the worst hurt (or, use example given above, if any), but not quite as bad?

3.  Which colour is like something that hurts just a little?

4.  Which colour is like no hurt at all?

<!-- -->

1.  Show the four colours (marked boxes, crayons, or markers) to the child in the order he has chosen them, from the colour chosen for the worst hurt to the colour chosen for no hurt.

2.  Ask the child to colour the body outlines where he hurts, using the colours he has chosen to show how much it hurts.

3.  When the child finishes, ask the child if this is a picture of how he hurts now or how he hurt earlier. Be specific about what earlier means by relating the time to an event, for example, at lunch or in the playroom.

*NOTE: Reprinted with permission of J.M. Eland from [McCaffery and Beebe, 1989.](http://www.painresearch.utah.edu/cancerpain/reference.html#MCCA89)*

*NOTE: Ask the child what their favourite colour is before starting and remove that one from the group of colours, as you don’t want them to associate pain with this colour**.***

The ‘E’ in QUESTT: Evaluate behaviour and physiological changes.

-   Physiological responses to pain include increased pulse, raised BP, profuse (intense) sweating, pallor or flushing, decreased oxygen saturation, dilated pupils, increased tone, rapid shallow respiration and hyperglycaemia.

-   Adaptation can occur with ongoing pain and physiological manifestations may be absent in chronic pain.

-   Children’s response to pain depends on their developmental age and stage, therefore it is important to understand what these are. The following table indicates the typical responses to both acute and chronic pain according to the developmental stage.

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td><strong>Acute pain</strong></td><td><strong>Chronic pain</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Newborns</strong></td><td><ul><li><p>Crying and moaning</p></li><li><p>Muscle rigidity</p></li><li><p>Flexion and flailing</p></li><li><p>Diaphoresis (perspiring a lot)</p></li><li><p>Irritability</p></li><li><p>Guarding</p></li><li><p>Reflex withdrawal to painful procedures</p></li></ul></td><td><ul><li><p>Apathy</p></li><li><p>Lack of interest in surrounding</p></li><li><p>Irritability</p></li><li><p>Changes in sleeping and eating patterns</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Toddlers and pre-schoolers</strong></td><td><ul><li><p>Crying, screaming and vocalizing hurt</p></li><li><p>Facial expression: eye squeeze, brow bulge, open mouth, taut tongue, chin quivering, grimacing</p></li><li><p>Thrashing of arms and legs</p></li><li><p>Pushes away, withdraws limbs</p></li><li><p>Clings to parent/caregiver</p></li><li><p>Restless and irritable</p></li></ul></td><td><ul><li><p>Moody</p></li><li><p>Unruly behaviour</p></li><li><p>Decreased play</p></li><li><p>Change in appetite</p></li><li><p>Change in sleep pattern</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>School-aged children</strong></td><td><ul><li><p>Crying</p></li><li><p>Muscle rigidity, clenched fists, white knuckles, clenched teeth, closed eyes</p></li><li><p>Stalling techniques when anticipating a painful procedure</p></li></ul></td><td><ul><li><p>School refusal</p></li><li><p>Declining school performance</p></li><li><p>Decreased socialisation</p></li><li><p>Anxiety and depression</p></li><li><p>Disturbed sleep</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Adolescents</strong></td><td><ul><li><p>Verbalisation of pain</p></li><li><p>Muscle tension</p></li><li><p>Loss of appetite</p></li><li><p>Insomnia or hypersomnia</p></li></ul></td><td><ul><li><p>Depression and anxiety</p></li><li><p>Low self-esteem</p></li><li><p>Decreased socialisation</p></li><li><p>Drug and/or alcohol abuse</p></li><li><p>Insomnia or hypersomnia</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

The ‘S’ in QUESTT: Secure parent or caregiver’s involvement.

-   **Listen to mothers, fathers and caregivers** as they know their child the best.

-   Include them in the decision-making process.

-   They are more tuned to subtle changes in their child’s behaviour.

-   They know what works best to comfort their child.

The ‘T’ in QUESTT: Take the cause of the pain into account.

-   Consider the pathophysiology of the underlying problem i.e., the cause of the pain.

-   Identify whether the pain may be unrelated to the disease or condition, e.g. toothache.

-   Descriptions of the type of pain help to determine its cause and management.

The ‘T’ in QUESTT: Take action and evaluate the results.

-   **Assess pain.**

-   **Develop the treatment plan.**

-   **Treat the identified pain according to its cause.**

-   **Re-assess the pain by using the pain rating scales.**

-   **Revise the treatment plan.**

-   **Pain diaries are also helpful for constant re-evaluation in children with chronic pain.**

### Drug formulary

**A detailed Association for Paediatric Palliative Medicine’s (APPM) 2020 formulary with drug names, doses, side effects and contraindications can be accessed via the** [PatchSA website](http://patchsa.org/patchsa_ppc_formulary/)**.**

**The APPM formulary is the leading international resource and only authoritative guide on prescribing in paediatric palliative care. Many of these medicines are prescribed ‘off-licence’ and ‘on expert opinion’ as it is difficult to do studies in this vulnerable population. Caution needs to be exercised in children with renal or liver dysfunction and dose adjustments need to be made. Do note not all of the formulations mentioned in this resource are available in South Africa.**

What to look for when inspecting the site:

-   Pain or hardness

-   Bruising

-   Leaking

-   Swelling

-   Redness

-   Blood in the tubing

-   Shifting of the needle.

How to insert the butterfly needle:

1.  Wash and sterilise hands.

2.  Put on gloves.

3.  Prefill butterfly needle and tubing with normal saline.

> <img src="/media/image6.jpeg" style="width:3.3576in;height:2.52083in" alt="Image result for inserting subcutaneous butterfly needle cartoon" />

1.  Clean the site with Chlorhexidine 2%/alcohol swab (left to right, then up and down) for 15 seconds. Allow the skin to dry.

2.  Remove protective sheet from needle.

3.  Pinch a roll of tissue (approx. 2.5 cm) around the insertion site.

4.  Grasp and hold the pebbled side wings of the butterfly needle with bevel down, insert at a 45 degree angle to skin, insert the entire length of the needle into the skin.

> <img src="/media/image7.png" style="width:3.92157in;height:2.30208in" alt="Image result for how to insert a subcutaneous butterfly needle" />

1.  If blood appears in the tubing; discard the needle and start again with a new needle.

2.  Stick down the wings and the tubing securely. Loop the tubing to prevent it from dislodging.

3.  Attach to syringe driver tubing, place the syringe in the syringe driver and start infusion
