# **Appendix G** Age appropriate pain rating scales
{:title="Age appropriate pain rating scales"}

<div class="wide" markdown="1">
Age appropriate pain rating scales include the following:

1. Neonates, infants: Neonatal pain rating scale (NIPS) or facial expression tool
2. Nonverbal children or children under 3 years: FLACC scale
3. Children over 3 years of age: Wong Baker Faces pain scale
4. Children over 7 years of age: Numeric, word pain scale and Eland colour body tool
</div>

## Neonates

Assessing a neonate’s facial expression is a useful way of identifying pain and distress. Typical facial signs of pain in neonates are the following:

1. Eyebrows lowered and drawn together
2. A bulge between the eyebrows and vertical furrows on the forehead
3. Eyes slightly closed
4. Cheeks raised, nose broadened and bulging, deepened nasolabial fold
5. Open and squarish mouth.

Ask the child to show how bad the pain is with their hand. This is the internationally recognised version of this tool. In South Africa this tool has been adapted and may vary from region to region for example, a child showing you their thumb can mean thumbs up and ‘I am okay’. Therefore, always check what is used in a particular environment and ask the child what he or she means.

## Children over 7 years of age

### Numerical Rating Scale for children over 7 years of age

On a scale from 0 – 10, describe how strong your pain is.
</div>

| **No pain** | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | **Worst possible pain** |

### Word pain scale

| **No pain** | **Little pain** | **Medium pain** | **Severe pain** | **Worst pain** |
{:.wide}

### Drawing pain

Ask a child to ‘draw’ his or her pain. This often gives insight into the intensity and nature of the pain but may also reflect its psychosocial consequences or the child’s fears.

### PatchSA Colour Tool

#### Instructions for using the PatchSA Colour Tool:

> ![Figure D]({{ images }}/appendix-g-figure-d.svg)
{:.figure}

Based on the Eland Colour Tool (Eland & Anderson, 1977) the PatchSA Colour Tool can be used to locate and assess the intensity of pain in children.

After discussing with the child several things that have hurt or caused the child pain in the past: 

1.	Present the child with four crayons or markers of different colours. 
2.	Using the term that the family and child use to describe hurt or pain (the word 'pain' is used in these instructions), ask the following questions and after the child has answered, mark the appropriate square on the tool. 
  1.	Of these colours, which colour is most like the worst pain you have ever had, or the worst pain anybody could ever have?
  2.	Which colour is almost as much pain as the worst pain, but not quite as bad?
  3.	Which colour is like a little pain?
  4.	Which colour is like no pain at all?
3.	Show the four colours to the child in order, from the colour chosen for the worst pain to the colour chosen for no pain. 
4.	Ask the child to colour within the body outlines in the places where it hurts on their own body, using the colours chosen to show how much it hurts. 
5.	When finished, ask if this is a picture of how it hurts now or how it hurt earlier. Be specific about what earlier means by relating the time to an event, for example, at lunch or in the playroom.

Note
: Ask the child what their favourite colour is before starting and remove that one from the group of colours, as you don’t want them to associate pain with this colour.
