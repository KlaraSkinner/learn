# **Appendix G** Age appropriate pain rating scales
{:title="Age appropriate pain rating scales"}

<div class="wide" markdown="1">
Age appropriate pain rating scales include the following:

1. Neonates, infants: Neonatal pain rating scale (NIPS) or facial expression tool
2. Nonverbal children or children under 3 years: FLACC scale
3. Children over 3 years of age: Wong Baker Faces pain scale
4. Children over 7 years of age: Numeric, word pain scale and Eland colour body tool
</div>

## Neonates

Assessing a neonate’s facial expression is a useful way of identifying pain and distress. Typical facial signs of pain in neonates are the following:

1. Eyebrows lowered and drawn together
2. A bulge between the eyebrows and vertical furrows on the forehead
3. Eyes slightly closed
4. Cheeks raised, nose broadened and bulging, deepened nasolabial fold
5. Open and squarish mouth.

### Five-finger score

Ask the patient to show how bad the pain is with their hand.

{:.figure.fixed}

Ask the child to show how bad the pain is with their hand. This is the internationally recognised version of this tool. In South Africa this tool has been adapted and may vary from region to region for example, a child showing you their thumb can mean thumbs up and ‘I am okay’. Therefore, always check what is used in a particular environment and ask the child what he or she means.

## Children over 7 years of age

### Numerical Rating Scale for children over 7 years of age

On a scale from 0 – 10, describe how strong your pain is.
</div>

| **No pain** | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | **Worst possible pain** |

### Word pain scale

| **No pain** | **Little pain** | **Medium pain** | **Severe pain** | **Worst pain** |
{:.wide}

### Drawing pain

Ask a child to ‘draw’ his or her pain. This often gives insight into the intensity and nature of the pain but may also reflect its psychosocial consequences or the child’s fears.

### Eland Body Tool

#### Directions for use:

> ![Figure D]({{ images }}/appendix-g-figure-d.svg)
{:.figure}

After discussing with the child several things that have hurt the child in the past:

1. Present three crayons or markers to the child.
2. Ask the following questions, and after the child has answered, mark the appropriate square on the tool (e.g. severe pain, worst hurt), and put that colour away from the others. For convenience, the word ‘hurt’ is used here, but whatever term the child uses should be substituted. The phrase or word chosen will depend on the child's experience and what the child is able to understand. Some children may be able to imagine much worse pain than they have ever had, while other children can only understand what they have experienced. Of course, some children may have experienced the worst pain they can imagine. Ask the child these questions:
   1. Of these colours, which colour is most like the worst hurt you have ever had (using whatever example the child has given) or the worst hurt anybody could ever have?
   2. Which colour is almost as much hurt as the worst hurt (or, use example given above, if any), but not quite as bad?
   3. Which colour is like something that hurts just a little?
   4. Which colour is like no hurt at all?

3. Show the four colours (marked boxes, crayons, or markers) to the child in the order he has chosen them, from the colour chosen for the worst hurt to the colour chosen for no hurt.
4. Ask the child to colour the body outlines where he hurts, using the colours he has chosen to show how much it hurts.
5. When the child finishes, ask the child if this is a picture of how he hurts now or how he hurt earlier. Be specific about what earlier means by relating the time to an event, for example, at lunch or in the playroom.

Note
: Ask the child what their favourite colour is before starting and remove that one from the group of colours, as you don’t want them to associate pain with this colour.
