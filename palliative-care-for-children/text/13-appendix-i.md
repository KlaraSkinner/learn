2. Remove protective sheet from needle.
3. Pinch a roll of tissue (approx. 2.5 cm) around the insertion site.

1. If blood appears in the tubing; discard the needle and start again with a new needle.
2. Stick down the wings and the tubing securely. Loop the tubing to prevent it from dislodging.
3. Attach to syringe driver tubing, place the syringe in the syringe driver and start infusion
