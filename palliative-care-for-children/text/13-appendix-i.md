What to look for when inspecting the site:

- Pain or hardness
- Bruising
- Leaking
- Swelling
- Redness
- Blood in the tubing
- Shifting of the needle.

How to insert the butterfly needle:

1. Wash and sterilise hands.
2. Put on gloves.
3. Prefill butterfly needle and tubing with normal saline.
4. Clean the site with Chlorhexidine 2%/alcohol swab (left to right, then up and down) for 15 seconds. Allow the skin to dry.
5. Remove protective sheet from needle.
6. Pinch a roll of tissue (approx. 2.5 cm) around the insertion site.
7. Grasp and hold the pebbled side wings of the butterfly needle with bevel down, insert at a 45 degree angle to skin, insert the entire length of the needle into the skin.
8. If blood appears in the tubing; discard the needle and start again with a new needle.
9. Stick down the wings and the tubing securely. Loop the tubing to prevent it from dislodging.
10. Attach to syringe driver tubing, place the syringe in the syringe driver and start infusion
